1. The folder contains four m files:'main','f','gen' and 'test'.
2. The usage method is to open the VUH-English folder in MATLAB and first run 'main'. If the running time is too long, you can reduce the 'maxdiedai' on line 17 and rerun it, or add a breakpoint on line 274 during the running process, and wait for the program to pause before ending the run. After running the 'main', the last column of 'canshumax' in the workspace is the optimized parameter values. Continuing to run 'test' can provide more details such as visualization and statistical information.
3. As an example, only 4 flood events were entered in the 'main'. Using only the first three events to calibrate parameters will inevitably lead to overfitting, resulting in poor performance of the fourth event when tested. Due to the randomness of the calibration algorithm, recalibrating parameters may yield better results. But the correct solution should be to add more flood events.
4. The content in VUH-Chinese is completely consistent with VUH-English, except that the comments have been changed to Chinese. Please refer to the comments in the code for more details.

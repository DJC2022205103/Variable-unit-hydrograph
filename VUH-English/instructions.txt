1. The folder contains four m files:'main','f','gen' and 'test'.
2. The usage method is to open the VUH-English folder in MATLAB and first run 'main'. If the running time is too long, you can reduce the 'maxdiedai' on line 17 and rerun it, or add a breakpoint on line 274 during the running process, and wait for the program to pause before ending the run. After running the 'main', the last column of 'canshumax' in the workspace is the optimized parameter values. Continuing to run 'test' can provide more details such as visualization and statistical information.
3. Due to the randomness of this calibration algorithm, different results may be obtained for each calibration. If it is necessary to improve the accuracy, the number of iterations of the algorithm should be increased, that is, the 'maxdiedai' in 'main' should be increased. The number of iterations used in the research was on the order of 10e7, and the running time was approximately two weeks.
4. The content in VUH-Chinese is completely consistent with VUH-English, except that the comments have been changed to Chinese. Please refer to the comments in the code for more details.
